Decrypts/deobfuscates pyobfuscate obfuscated python scripts. Goes to show how shit and probably pasted it is.

NOTE:
* IF YOUR OBFUSCATED SCRIPT IS SINGLE LAYER, USE single_layer_decryptor.py
* IF YOUR OBFUSCATED SCRIPT IS MULTIPLE LAYERS, USE multiple_layer_decryptor.py !

In case, in future, they change the proto or something, I'll update it.
You can pretty much bruteforce the number of layers yourself, just change "Decryption Factor" variable. It's currently `64`.
